Revisions: 

Lab1
Remarks:
1. Don't use atoi and atof --> use stoll stod --> 'cause they can handle exceptions
2. Don't use hash or write hashing pragmatically --> Use std

Lab 2
Remarks:

1.Use encapsulation.

2. Randomly generate ID. --> random int

3. Avoid entering ID for function min product. Create Shop manager to automatically update list of shops and products. --> Nested classes

Lab 3
Remarks:

1.Either create separate classes for all vehicles or create classes Air and Land 'cause they have similar function or structure. Both is okay.

2. In future cases, where ALL vehicles functions are different -> Create classes for each separate type of vehicle (Inheritance & Polymorphism).
